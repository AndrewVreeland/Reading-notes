### Growth
A growth mindset is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed and improved through effort and learning, rather than being fixed traits. It is characterized by a focus on growth, learning, and continuous improvement, and is associated with a positive attitude towards challenges and setbacks. 

#### Growth Reminders
1. **_Focus on the process_** rather than the outcome. Instead of worrying about the end result, try to focus on the steps and effort you are putting in to improve and learn. 
2. **_Embrace challenges_** and setbacks as opportunities for growth. When faced with a difficult task or challenge, try to see it as an opportunity to learn and grow rather than as a threat to your abilities.
3. **_Seek feedback_** and embrace constructive criticism. Ask for feedback from others and be open to hearing and learning from their perspective, even if it's not what you want to hear. This can help you identify areas where you can improve and grow.
