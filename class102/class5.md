## Inserting CSS

1. External CSS:  you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
2. Internal CSS: An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
3. Inline CSS: An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

## Terms

1. CSS selector: is the part of a CSS rule that describes what elements in a document the rule will match. The matching elements will have the rule's specified style applied to them.
2. Property: is a characteristic (like color) whose associated value defines one aspect of how the browser should display the element.
3. Modules: As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules.
