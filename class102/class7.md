# Class 7 Reading Assignment


## Terms

* Contorl Flow: The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

* JavaScript function: is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

* Javascript execution: A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

* Javascript Operator: The Assignment Operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

## Functions

* A function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

* You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

* The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function: When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)

* Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.

### Functions as variables

* Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.

* Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.

## Javascript Operators

### Types of Operators

* Arithmetic Operators: are used to perform arithmetic on numbers
    1. +Addition
    2. -Subtraction
    3. *Multiplication
