# Class 4 Reading Assignment

## *These are my notes from Module 4*

## HTML (hyper text markup language)

* structure/framework
* In charge of websites content
* Semantic, plainly describes meaning/purpose (words to describe the boxes that things go into such as HEader and footer)
* < h1 >Content goes here< /h1 >
* < a href="URL-goes-here" > < /a >
* < img />
* HTML is tags that goes around content to create boxes.
* low fidelity not much information
