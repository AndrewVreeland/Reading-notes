# Class 4 Reading Assignment

#### *These are my notes from Module 4*.

### HTML (hyper text markup language)

* HTML consists of elements, which are represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets, such as <p  and </p  for a paragraph.

* The most important element in an HTML document is the <html element, which serves as the container for all other elements.

* The <head element contains meta information about the document, such as the title, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab, and links to other resources, such as stylesheets.

* The <body> element contains the visible content of the web page, such as text, images, and videos.

* Common layout and structural elements include: <header, <nav, <main, <article, <aside, <footer

* HTML5 also introduce new semantic element, to define specific role and sections on the page, such as <header, <nav, <section, <article, <aside, <footer, <figcaption, <figure>, <mark, <time, <progress, <meter, <output, <details, <summary, <data, <time, <video, <audio, <canvas and many more.

* You can add visual styling to the HTML elements using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

## Things to note

* ACP == add, commit, push
if file staging is successful, git status will change the file name color from red to green; if commit successful, no green/red file should be seen

* local repository does NOT sync with github, must be pushed from origin

### Useful information

* A wireframe is a visual representation of the structure and layout of a web page, used to plan and design the user interface.
