## Text Editor
A text editor is a computer program that allows users to create and edit plain text files. It is commonly used for writing code, creating documents, and editing configuration files. Unlike a word processor, a text editor is designed for working with plain text and does not include advanced formatting options.

Text Editors vs IDEs

A text editor only edits text, but an IDE is a software development package that has the capabilities beyond text editing, including managing, compling, and debugging.

### Things to look for within a text editor
1. Code completion
2. Syntax highlighting 
3. A nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue) 
4. The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

## Cheat Sheet
1. Change Directory: use the "cd"
2. Remove a file or directory: use the "rm" command to delete things.
3. Copy a file: use the "cp" command to make a copy of a file.
4. List Files: use the "ls" command 
5. To clear the current page use the "clear" command 
6. Make a new directory: use the "mkdir" command to create a new folder.
