1. ## Question3: what is your greatest weakness 

* situation:
  * I am someone who tends to be overly critical of my own work. While striving for excellence is important to me, I sometimes find myself second-guessing my decisions or focusing too much on small details.
* task
  * While I believe that self-reflection is important for personal and professional growth, I also recognize that being too self-critical can be counterproductive and can lead to negative outcomes.
* action
  * To address this weakness, I've been working on cultivating a more balanced perspective by focusing on the positives in my work and reminding myself of past successes when I start to feel overly critical. I've also sought feedback from colleagues and supervisors to help me gain a more objective view of my work, and I've been working on developing strategies to move past mistakes and setbacks more quickly.
* result
  * While this is still an area where I am actively working to improve, I believe that my efforts have already paid off in terms of increased productivity, improved relationships with coworkers, and a greater sense of confidence in my abilities. By being aware of my tendency towards self-criticism and taking steps to address it, I'm able to stay focused on my goals and continue to grow both personally and professionally.
