## Reading

[JavaScript Object Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics)

1.How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
      * An object is a collection of similar data. like someone puting their name and birthday down in an application, it will be saved as an object.
2.What are some advantages to creating object literals?
      * shorter syntax, easier to type and to read.
3.How do objects differ from arrays?
      * arrays use index numbers to access information where as objects use the name associated with the data
4.Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation
      * if an objects property name is held in a variable then you have to use bracket notation.
5.Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
      * This is equivelent to Spot in this instance. Becuase it refers to the object that the code is written inside of. The benefit of using 'This' is that you are able to use the same method definition for mutiple objects.

## Intro to DOM

[DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
1.What is the DOM?
      * The Document Object Model is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the oage so that programs can have access to and change the document structure style and content. It allows progamming languages to interract with the page.
2.Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
      * Dom can be accessed by any language. Without the DOM there would be no way for the Javascript to actually interact with the websites domain to change anything.
