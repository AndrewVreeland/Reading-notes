# Class 4 Reading Assignment

## [HTML Hyper Links](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
      * the  <a> element
2. The href attribute contains what information?
      * The link to the new document
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
      * Don't report the URL in the link text. Bad practice due to screen readers
      * don't say link or links in link text it is extra noise
      * keep link text as short as possible so screen readers can interpret the entire link text
      * don't label multiple links as the same text, out of context 'click here' will be confusing to screen readers

## Document fragments

Linking to a specific part of a document 

* ex.  <p>
  Want to write us a letter? Use our
  <a href="contacts.html#Mailing_address">mailing address</a>.
</p>

## [CSS Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout)

* [Css Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow); [CSS Layout: Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
      * the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.
2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
      * block level elements fills all available inline space of the parent element, where inline element is just the size of the content, except for images.
      *  block level elements all sit on new lines, one after another with margin seperating them where as inline elements all sit on the same line. if there is no space the content will flow down to a new line
3. static positioning is the default for every html element.
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
      * The Elements sit on their own layer and now does not interfere with the rest of the page. for ex. popup info boxes, control menus and rolloever panels.
      * The ability to use top, bottom, left, and right to resize elements if needed

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
      * fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

## [Learn JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

* [Functions - Reusable Blocks Of Code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
      * Delcaring a function is essentially creating said functions where as invoking the function is telling JS to run the code for said function
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
      * setting values that are needed for the function to run properly for ex. function multiply(A,B){return A x B} where as the argument is what values you use when invoking the function multiply(2,3)

## Miscellaneous

* [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
      * learning from fellow students - This is definitely my number one. Working with others allows you to collaborate, answer each others problems, and discover new and intresting ways to tackle the issues at hand.
      * job interview readiness is extremely important and honestly anything that prepares us for this step is a win in my book.
