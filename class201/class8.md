## *These are my notes from Module 8*

## CSS LAYOUT
[Learn CSS - Flexbox](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/)

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
      * Taking a bunch of items of different sizes and returning the best layout for those items.
2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
      * the main axis is horizontal, items move as a group while the cross axis is vertical, and is opposit to the main axis when considering directioal calls. for ex. if flex-directoin is row the cross axis runs along the column where as the main axis runs along the row. 
3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
      * row-reverse and column-reverse do not affect the logical order only the visual order so that will negatively effect screen readers.

 [CSS Layout-Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)
1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
      * it allows for easy spacing of items, you can easily change the order of your items and your containers margins do not collapse within the margins of it's content.
2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
      * I enjoy working with CSS I am not sure what I want to do indrusty-wise yet so at this point I am trying to soak up a bit of everything as I go. So anytime working with CSS or any of the other languages for that matter is a win in my book.
